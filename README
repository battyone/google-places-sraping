The script scrapes Google Maps search results using Python Selenium bindings (without using Google Places API) - Place's name, adress, zipcode, state, website
In order to run it you have to have chromdriver.exe and Google Chrome installed on your machine.
To use it you need to provide search query and coordinates for area where search is to be perfomed (currently it is US and Canada).
